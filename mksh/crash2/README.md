Hash: 4ae224ddf242a06aaed9962641ba1079.4ae224ddf242a06aaed9962641ba1079
Exploitability Classification: EXPLOITABLE
Explanation: GDB generated an error while unwinding the stack and/or the stack contained return addresses that were not mapped in the inferior's process address space and/or the stack pointer is pointing to a location outside the default stack region. These conditions likely indicate stack corruption, which is generally considered exploitable.
